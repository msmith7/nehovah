This is the code base that runs Nehovah to generate nologisms based on two
source words. The code is "AS_IS" and no guarantees are made as to its
functionality and/or readability. But please ask any questions if you are
interested in using this code: nehovah@axon.cs.byu.edu

The code compiles using this command:

g++ testDriver.cpp neo.cpp Neologism.cpp PopWord.cpp WNDictionaryTree.cpp WNTNode.cpp WNTreeCreator.cpp Word.cpp web/MoreWordsSearch.cpp web/TopTensSearch.cpp -lboost_regex -lcurl -lwordnet -o nehovah

and

g++ sort.cpp -o sort

The commands are ran as:

./nehovah <sourceWord1> <sourceWord2>

and

./sort <fileLocationOfNeologisms> <popCultureWeight> <conceptWeight> <syllableWeight> <uniqueWeight>
